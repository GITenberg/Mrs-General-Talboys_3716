Countries&rdquo; edition by David Price, email

<h1>MRS. GENERAL TALBOYS.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> Mrs. General Talboys first made
up her mind to pass the winter of 1859 at Rome I never clearly
understood.&nbsp; To myself she explained her purposes, soon
after her arrival at the Eternal City, by declaring, in her own
enthusiastic manner, that she was inspired by a burning desire to
drink fresh at the still living fountains of classical poetry and
sentiment.&nbsp; But I always thought that there was something
more than this in it.&nbsp; Classical poetry and sentiment were
doubtless very dear to her; but so also, I imagine, were the
substantial comforts of Hardover Lodge, the General&rsquo;s house
in Berkshire; and I do not think that she would have emigrated
for the winter had there not been some slight domestic
misunderstanding.&nbsp; Let this, however, be fully made
clear,&mdash;that such misunderstanding, if it existed, must have
been simply an affair of temper.&nbsp; No impropriety of conduct
has, I am very sure, ever been imputed to the lady.&nbsp; The
General, as all the world knows, is hot; and Mrs. Talboys, when
the sweet rivers of her enthusiasm are unfed by congenial waters,
can, I believe, make herself disagreeable.</p>
<p>But be this as it may, in November, 1859, Mrs. Talboys came
among us English at Rome, and soon succeeded in obtaining for
herself a comfortable footing in our society.&nbsp; We all
thought her more remarkable for her mental attributes than for
physical perfection; but, nevertheless, she was, in her own way,
a sightly woman.&nbsp; She had no special brilliance, either of
eye or complexion, such as would produce sudden flames in
susceptible hearts; nor did she seem to demand instant homage by
the form and step of a goddess; but we found her to be a
good-looking woman of some thirty or thirty-three years of age,
with soft, peach-like cheeks,&mdash;rather too like those of a
cherub, with sparkling eyes which were hardly large enough, with
good teeth, a white forehead, a dimpled chin and a full
bust.&nbsp; Such, outwardly, was Mrs. General Talboys.&nbsp; The
description of the inward woman is the purport to which these few
pages will be devoted.</p>
<p>There are two qualities to which the best of mankind are much
subject, which are nearly related to each other, and as to which
the world has not yet decided whether they are to be classed
among the good or evil attributes of our nature.&nbsp; Men and
women are under the influence of them both, but men oftenest
undergo the former, and women the latter.&nbsp; They are ambition
and enthusiasm.&nbsp; Now Mrs. Talboys was an enthusiastic
woman.</p>
<p>As to ambition, generally as the world agrees with Mark Antony
in stigmatising it as a grievous fault, I am myself clear that it
is a virtue; but with ambition at present we have no
concern.&nbsp; Enthusiasm also, as I think, leans to
virtue&rsquo;s side; or, at least, if it be a fault, of all
faults it is the prettiest.&nbsp; But then, to partake at all of
virtue, or even to be in any degree pretty, the enthusiasm must
be true.</p>
<p>Bad coin is known from good by the ring of it; and so is bad
enthusiasm.&nbsp; Let the coiner be ever so clever at his art, in
the coining of enthusiasm the sound of true gold can never be
imparted to the false metal.&nbsp; And I doubt whether the
cleverest she in the world can make false enthusiasm palatable to
the taste of man.&nbsp; To the taste of any woman the enthusiasm
of another woman is never very palatable.</p>
<p>We understood at Home that Mrs. Talboys had a considerable
family,&mdash;four or five children, we were told; but she
brought with her only one daughter, a little girl about twelve
years of age.&nbsp; She had torn herself asunder, as she told me,
from the younger nurslings of her heart, and had left them to the
care of a devoted female attendant, whose love was all but
maternal.&nbsp; And then she said a word or two about the
General, in terms which made me almost think that this
quasi-maternal love extended itself beyond the children.&nbsp;
The idea, however, was a mistaken one, arising from the strength
of her language, to which I was then unaccustomed.&nbsp; I have
since become aware that nothing can be more decorous than old
Mrs. Upton, the excellent head-nurse at Hardover Lodge; and no
gentleman more discreet in his conduct than General Talboys.</p>
<p>And I may as well here declare, also, that there could be no
more virtuous woman than the General&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Her
marriage vow was to her paramount to all other vows and bonds
whatever.&nbsp; The General&rsquo;s honour was quite safe when he
sent her off to Rome by herself; and he no doubt knew that it was
so.&nbsp; Illi robur et &aelig;s triplex, of which I believe no
weapons of any assailant could get the better.&nbsp; But,
nevertheless, we used to fancy that she had no repugnance to
impropriety in other women,&mdash;to what the world generally
calls impropriety.&nbsp; Invincibly attached herself to the
marriage tie, she would constantly speak of it as by no means
necessarily binding on others; and, virtuous herself as any
griffin of propriety, she constantly patronised, at any rate, the
theory of infidelity in her neighbours.&nbsp; She was very eager
in denouncing the prejudices of the English world, declaring that
she had found existence among them to be no longer possible for
herself.&nbsp; She was hot against the stern unforgiveness of
British matrons, and equally eager in reprobating the stiff
conventionalities of a religion in which she said that none of
its votaries had faith, though they all allowed themselves to be
enslaved.</p>
<p>We had at that time a small set at Rome, consisting chiefly of
English and Americans, who habitually met at each other&rsquo;s
rooms, and spent many of our evening hours in discussing Italian
politics.&nbsp; We were, most of us, painters, poets, novelists,
or sculptors;&mdash;perhaps I should say would-be painters,
poets, novelists, and sculptors,&mdash;aspirants hoping to become
some day recognised; and among us Mrs. Talboys took her place,
naturally enough, on account of a very pretty taste she had for
painting.</p>
<p>I do not know that she ever originated anything that was
grand; but she made some nice copies, and was fond, at any rate,
of art conversation.&nbsp; She wrote essays, too, which she
showed in confidence to various gentlemen, and had some idea of
taking lessons in modelling.</p>
<p>In all our circle Conrad Mackinnon, an American, was, perhaps,
the person most qualified to be styled its leader.&nbsp; He was
one who absolutely did gain his living, and an ample living too,
by his pen, and was regarded on all sides as a literary lion,
justified by success in roaring at any tone he might
please.&nbsp; His usual roar was not exactly that of a
sucking-dove or a nightingale; but it was a good-humoured roar,
not very offensive to any man, and apparently acceptable enough
to some ladies.&nbsp; He was a big burly man, near to fifty as I
suppose, somewhat awkward in his gait, and somewhat loud in his
laugh.&nbsp; But though nigh to fifty, and thus ungainly, he
liked to be smiled on by pretty women, and liked, as some said,
to be flattered by them also.&nbsp; If so, he should have been
happy, for the ladies at Rome at that time made much of Conrad
Mackinnon.</p>
<p>Of Mrs. Mackinnon no one did make very much, and yet she was
one of the sweetest, dearest, quietest, little creatures that
ever made glad a man&rsquo;s fireside.&nbsp; She was exquisitely
pretty, always in good humour, never stupid, self-denying to a
fault, and yet she was generally in the background.&nbsp; She
would seldom come forward of her own will, but was contented to
sit behind her teapot and hear Mackinnon do his roaring.&nbsp; He
was certainly much given to what the world at Rome called
flirting, but this did not in the least annoy her.&nbsp; She was
twenty years his junior, and yet she never flirted with any
one.&nbsp; Women would tell her&mdash;good-natured
friends&mdash;how Mackinnon went on; but she received such
tidings as an excellent joke, observing that he had always done
the same, and no doubt always would until he was ninety.&nbsp; I
do believe that she was a happy woman; and yet I used to think
that she should have been happier.&nbsp; There is, however, no
knowing the inside of another man&rsquo;s house, or reading the
riddles of another man&rsquo;s joy and sorrow.</p>
<p>We had also there another lion,&mdash;a lion
cub,&mdash;entitled to roar a little, and of him also I must say
something.&nbsp; Charles O&rsquo;Brien was a young man, about
twenty-five years of age, who had sent out from his studio in the
preceding year a certain bust, supposed by his admirers to be
unsurpassed by any effort of ancient or modern genius.&nbsp; I am
no judge of sculpture, and will not, therefore, pronounce an
opinion; but many who considered themselves to be judges,
declared that it was a &ldquo;goodish head and shoulders,&rdquo;
and nothing more.&nbsp; I merely mention the fact, as it was on
the strength of that head and shoulders that O&rsquo;Brien
separated himself from a throng of others such as himself in
Rome, walked solitary during the days, and threw himself at the
feet of various ladies when the days were over.&nbsp; He had
ridden on the shoulders of his bust into a prominent place in our
circle, and there encountered much feminine admiration&mdash;from
Mrs. General Talboys and others.</p>
<p>Some eighteen or twenty of us used to meet every Sunday
evening in Mrs. Mackinnon&rsquo;s drawing-room.&nbsp; Many of us,
indeed, were in the habit of seeing each other daily, and of
visiting together the haunts in Rome which are best loved by
art-loving strangers; but here, in this drawing-room, we were
sure to come together, and here before the end of November, Mrs.
Talboys might always be found, not in any accustomed seat, but
moving about the room as the different male mental attractions of
our society might chance to move themselves.&nbsp; She was at
first greatly taken by Mackinnon,&mdash;who also was, I think, a
little stirred by her admiration, though he stoutly denied the
charge.&nbsp; She became, however, very dear to us all before she
left us, and certainly we owed to her our love, for she added
infinitely to the joys of our winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come here to refresh myself,&rdquo; she said to
Mackinnon one evening&mdash;to Mackinnon and myself; for we were
standing together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I get you tea?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you have something to eat?&rdquo; Mackinnon
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no;&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tea, yes;
but for Heaven&rsquo;s sake let nothing solid dispel the
associations of such a meeting as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might have dined early,&rdquo; said
Mackinnon.&nbsp; Now Mackinnon was a man whose own dinner was
very dear to him.&nbsp; I have seen him become hasty and
unpleasant, even under the pillars of the Forum, when he thought
that the party were placing his fish in jeopardy by their desire
to linger there too long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early!&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; No; I know not when it
was.&nbsp; One dines and sleeps in obedience to that dull clay
which weighs down so generally the particle of our spirit.&nbsp;
But the clay may sometimes be forgotten.&nbsp; Here I can always
forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you asked for refreshment,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; She only looked at me, whose small attempts at prose
composition had, up to that time, been altogether unsuccessful,
and then addressed herself in reply to Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the air which we breathe that fills our lungs and
gives us life and light.&nbsp; It is that which refreshes us if
pure, or sinks us into stagnation if it be foul.&nbsp; Let me for
awhile inhale the breath of an invigorating literature.&nbsp; Sit
down, Mr. Mackinnon; I have a question that I must put to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she succeeded in carrying him off into
a corner.&nbsp; As far as I could see he went willingly enough at
that time, though he soon became averse to any long retirement in
company with Mrs. Talboys.</p>
<p>We none of us quite understood what were her exact ideas on
the subject of revealed religion.&nbsp; Somebody, I think, had
told her that there were among us one or two whose opinions were
not exactly orthodox according to the doctrines of the
established English church.&nbsp; If so, she was determined to
show us that she also was advanced beyond the prejudices of an
old and dry school of theology.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have thrown down
all the barriers of religion,&rdquo; she said to poor Mrs.
Mackinnon, &ldquo;and am looking for the sentiments of a pure
Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrown down all the barriers of religion!&rdquo; said
Mrs. Mackinnon, in a tone of horror which was not
appreciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Talboys, with an exulting
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are not the days for such trammels gone
by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yet you hold by Christianity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pure Christianity, unstained by blood and perjury, by
hypocrisy and verbose genuflection.&nbsp; Can I not worship and
say my prayers among the clouds?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she pointed to
the lofty ceiling and the handsome chandelier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Ida goes to church,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Mackinnon.&nbsp; Ida Talboys was her daughter.&nbsp; Now, it may
be observed, that many who throw down the barriers of religion,
so far as those barriers may affect themselves, still maintain
them on behalf of their children.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Talboys; &ldquo;dear Ida! her soft spirit is not yet adapted
to receive the perfect truth.&nbsp; We are obliged to govern
children by the strength of their prejudices.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then she moved away, for it was seldom that Mrs. Talboys remained
long in conversation with any lady.</p>
<p>Mackinnon, I believe, soon became tired of her.&nbsp; He liked
her flattery, and at first declared that she was clever and nice;
but her niceness was too purely celestial to satisfy his mundane
tastes.&nbsp; Mackinnon himself can revel among the clouds in his
own writings, and can leave us sometimes in doubt whether he ever
means to come back to earth; but when his foot is on terra firma,
he loves to feel the earthly substratum which supports his
weight.&nbsp; With women he likes a hand that can remain an
unnecessary moment within his own, an eye that can glisten with
the sparkle of champagne, a heart weak enough to make its
owner&rsquo;s arm tremble within his own beneath the moonlight
gloom of the Coliseum arches.&nbsp; A dash of sentiment the while
makes all these things the sweeter; but the sentiment alone will
not suffice for him.&nbsp; Mrs. Talboys did, I believe, drink her
glass of champagne, as do other ladies; but with her it had no
such pleasing effect.&nbsp; It loosened only her tongue, but
never her eye.&nbsp; Her arm, I think, never trembled, and her
hand never lingered.&nbsp; The General was always safe, and
happy, perhaps, in his solitary safety.</p>
<p>It so happened that we had unfortunately among us two artists
who had quarrelled with their wives.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien, whom I
have before mentioned, was one of them.&nbsp; In his case, I
believe him to have been almost as free from blame as a man can
be whose marriage was in itself a fault.&nbsp; However, he had a
wife in Ireland some ten years older than himself; and though he
might sometimes almost forget the fact, his friends and
neighbours were well aware of it.&nbsp; In the other case the
whole fault probably was with the husband.&nbsp; He was an
ill-tempered, bad-hearted man, clever enough, but without
principle; and he was continually guilty of the great sin of
speaking evil of the woman whose name he should have been anxious
to protect.&nbsp; In both cases our friend Mrs. Talboys took a
warm interest, and in each of them she sympathised with the
present husband against the absent wife.</p>
<p>Of the consolation which she offered in the latter instance we
used to hear something from Mackinnon.&nbsp; He would repeat to
his wife, and to me and my wife, the conversations which she had
with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Brown;&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;I
pity him, with my very heart&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are aware that he has comforted himself in his
desolation,&rdquo; Mackinnon replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very well to what you allude.&nbsp; I think I
may say that I am conversant with all the circumstances of this
heart-blighting sacrifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Talboys was apt to
boast of the thorough confidence reposed in her by all those in
whom she took an interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, he has sought such
comfort in another love as the hard cruel world would allow
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps something more than that,&rdquo; said
Mackinnon.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has a family here in Rome, you know;
two little babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, I know it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cherub angels!&rdquo; and as she spoke she looked up into
the ugly face of Marcus Aurelius; for they were standing at the
moment under the figure of the great horseman on the
Campidoglio.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seen them, and they are the
children of innocence.&nbsp; If all the blood of all the Howards
ran in their veins it could not make their birth more
noble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if the father and mother of all the Howards had
never been married,&rdquo; said Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What; that from you, Mr. Mackinnon!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Talboys, turning her back with energy upon the equestrian statue,
and looking up into the faces, first of Pollux and then of
Castor, as though from them she might gain some inspiration on
the subject which Marcus Aurelius in his coldness had denied to
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;From you, who have so nobly claimed for mankind
the divine attributes of free action!&nbsp; From you, who have
taught my mind to soar above the petty bonds which one man in his
littleness contrives for the subjection of his brother.&nbsp;
Mackinnon! you who are so great!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she now looked
up into his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mackinnon, unsay those
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> illegitimate,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;and if there was any landed property&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landed property! and that from an American!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children are English, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landed property!&nbsp; The time will shortly
come&mdash;ay, and I see it coming&mdash;when that hateful word
shall be expunged from the calendar; when landed property shall
be no more.&nbsp; What! shall the free soul of a God-born man
submit itself for ever to such trammels as that?&nbsp; Shall we
never escape from the clay which so long has manacled the subtler
particles of the divine spirit?&nbsp; Ay, yes, Mackinnon;&rdquo;
and then she took him by the arm, and led him to the top of the
huge steps which lead down from the Campidoglio into the streets
of modern Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look down upon that countless
multitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mackinnon looked down, and saw three
groups of French soldiers, with three or four little men in each
group; he saw, also, a couple of dirty friars, and three priests
very slowly beginning the side ascent to the church of the Ara
C&oelig;li.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look down upon that countless
multitude,&rdquo; said Mrs. Talboys, and she stretched her arms
out over the half-deserted city.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are escaping
now from these trammels,&mdash;now, now,&mdash;now that I am
speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have escaped long ago from all such trammels as
that of landed property,&rdquo; said Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and from all terrestrial bonds,&rdquo; she
continued, not exactly remarking the pith of his last
observation; &ldquo;from bonds quasi-terrestrial and
quasi-celestial.&nbsp; The full-formed limbs of the present age,
running with quick streams of generous blood, will no longer bear
the ligatures which past times have woven for the decrepit.&nbsp;
Look down upon that multitude, Mackinnon; they shall all be
free.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, still clutching him by the arm, and
still standing at the top of those stairs, she gave forth her
prophecy with the fury of a Sybil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall all be free.&nbsp; Oh, Rome, thou eternal
one! thou who hast bowed thy neck to imperial pride and priestly
craft; thou who hast suffered sorely, even to this hour, from
Nero down to Pio Nono,&mdash;the days of thine oppression are
over.&nbsp; Gone from thy enfranchised ways for ever is the clang
of the Pr&aelig;torian cohorts and the more odious drone of
meddling monks!&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet, as Mackinnon observed,
there still stood the dirty friars and the small French soldiers;
and there still toiled the slow priests, wending their tedious
way up to the church of the Ara C&oelig;li.&nbsp; But that was
the mundane view of the matter,&mdash;a view not regarded by Mrs.
Talboys in her ecstasy.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Italia,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;O Italia una, one and indivisible in thy
rights, and indivisible also in thy wrongs! to us is it given to
see the accomplishment of thy glory.&nbsp; A people shall arise
around thine altars greater in the annals of the world than thy
Scipios, thy Gracchi, or thy C&aelig;sars.&nbsp; Not in torrents
of blood, or with screams of bereaved mothers, shall thy new
triumphs be stained.&nbsp; But mind shall dominate over matter;
and doomed, together with Popes and Bourbons, with cardinals,
diplomatists, and police spies, ignorance and prejudice shall be
driven from thy smiling terraces.&nbsp; And then Rome shall again
become the fair capital of the fairest region of Europe.&nbsp;
Hither shall flock the artisans of the world, crowding into thy
marts all that God and man can give.&nbsp; Wealth, beauty, and
innocence shall meet in thy streets&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a considerable change before that takes
place,&rdquo; said Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There shall be a considerable change,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mackinnon, to thee it is given to read the
signs of the time; and hast thou not read?&nbsp; Why have the
fields of Magenta and Solferino been piled with the corpses of
dying heroes?&nbsp; Why have the waters of the Mincio ran red
with the blood of martyrs?&nbsp; That Italy might be united and
Rome immortal.&nbsp; Here, standing on the Capitolium of the
ancient city, I say that it shall be so; and thou, Mackinnon, who
hearest me, knowest that my words are true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not then in Rome,&mdash;I may almost say there was
not in Italy, an Englishman or an American who did not wish well
to the cause for which Italy was and is still contending; as also
there is hardly one who does not now regard that cause as
well-nigh triumphant; but, nevertheless, it was almost impossible
to sympathise with Mrs. Talboys.&nbsp; As Mackinnon said, she
flew so high that there was no comfort in flying with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Brown and the rest of them
are down below.&nbsp; Shall we go and join them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Brown!&nbsp; How was it that, in speaking of his
troubles, we were led on to this heart-stirring theme?&nbsp; Yes,
I have seen them, the sweet angels; and I tell you also that I
have seen their mother.&nbsp; I insisted on going to her when I
heard her history from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is she like, Mrs. Talboys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; education has done more for some of us than for
others; and there are those from whose morals and sentiments we
might thankfully draw a lesson, whose manners and outward
gestures are not such as custom has made agreeable to us.&nbsp;
You, I know, can understand that.&nbsp; I have seen her, and feel
sure that she is pure in heart and high in principle.&nbsp; Has
she not sacrificed herself; and is not self-sacrifice the surest
guarantee for true nobility of character?&nbsp; Would Mrs.
Mackinnon object to my bringing them together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackinnon was obliged to declare that he thought his wife
would object; and from that time forth he and Mrs. Talboys ceased
to be very close in their friendship.&nbsp; She still came to the
house every Sunday evening, still refreshed herself at the
fountains of his literary rills; but her special prophecies from
henceforth were poured into other ears.&nbsp; And it so happened
that O&rsquo;Brien now became her chief ally.&nbsp; I do not
remember that she troubled herself much further with the cherub
angels or with their mother; and I am inclined to think that,
taking up warmly, as she did, the story of O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s
matrimonial wrongs, she forgot the little history of the
Browns.&nbsp; Be that as it may, Mrs. Talboys and O&rsquo;Brien
now became strictly confidential, and she would enlarge by the
half-hour together on the miseries of her friend&rsquo;s
position, to any one whom she could get to hear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Fanny,&rdquo; Mackinnon said
to his wife one day,&mdash;to his wife and to mine, for we were
all together; &ldquo;we shall have a row in the house if we
don&rsquo;t take care.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien will be making love to
Mrs. Talboys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mackinnon.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are always thinking that somebody is going to make love to some
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody always is,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s old enough to be his mother,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that matter to an Irishman?&rdquo; said
Mackinnon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, I doubt if there is more than
five years&rsquo; difference between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be more than that,&rdquo; said my
wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ida Talboys is twelve, I know, and I am not
quite sure that Ida is the eldest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had a son in the Guards it would make no
difference,&rdquo; said Mackinnon.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are men who
consider themselves bound to make love to a woman under certain
circumstances, let the age of the lady be what it may.&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Brien is such a one; and if she sympathises with him much
oftener, he will mistake the matter, and go down on his
knees.&nbsp; You ought to put him on his guard,&rdquo; he said,
addressing himself to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;if they are two fools, they must, like other fools, pay
the price of their folly.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a rule there could be
no softer creature than Mrs. Mackinnon; but it seemed to me that
her tenderness never extended itself in the direction of Mrs.
Talboys.</p>
<p>Just at this time, towards the end, that is, of November, we
made a party to visit the tombs which lie along the Appian Way,
beyond that most beautiful of all sepulchres, the tomb of Cecilia
Metella.&nbsp; It was a delicious day, and we had driven along
this road for a couple of miles beyond the walls of the city,
enjoying the most lovely view which the neighbourhood of Rome
affords,&mdash;looking over the wondrous ruins of the old
aqueducts, up towards Tivoli and Palestrina.&nbsp; Of all the
environs of Rome this is, on a fair clear day, the most
enchanting; and here perhaps, among a world of tombs, thoughts
and almost memories of the old, old days come upon one with the
greatest force.&nbsp; The grandeur of Rome is best seen and
understood from beneath the walls of the Coliseum, and its beauty
among the pillars of the Forum and the arches of the Sacred Way;
but its history and fall become more palpable to the mind, and
more clearly realised, out here among the tombs, where the eyes
rest upon the mountains whose shades were cool to the old Romans
as to us,&mdash;than anywhere within the walls of the city.&nbsp;
Here we look out at the same Tivoli and the same Pr&aelig;neste,
glittering in the sunshine, embowered among the far-off valleys,
which were dear to them; and the blue mountains have not crumbled
away into ruins.&nbsp; Within Rome itself we can see nothing as
they saw it.</p>
<p>Our party consisted of some dozen or fifteen persons, and as a
hamper with luncheon in it had been left on the grassy slope at
the base of the tomb of Cecilia Metella, the expedition had in it
something of the nature of a picnic.&nbsp; Mrs. Talboys was of
course with us, and Ida Talboys.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien also was
there.&nbsp; The hamper had been prepared in Mrs.
Mackinnon&rsquo;s room, under the immediate eye of Mackinnon
himself, and they therefore were regarded as the dominant spirits
of the party.&nbsp; My wife was leagued with Mrs. Mackinnon, as
was usually the case; and there seemed to be a general opinion
among those who were closely in confidence together, that
something would happen in the O&rsquo;Brien-Talboys matter.&nbsp;
The two had been inseparable on the previous evening, for Mrs.
Talboys had been urging on the young Irishman her counsels
respecting his domestic troubles.&nbsp; Sir Cresswell Cresswell,
she had told him, was his refuge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should his
soul submit to bonds which the world had now declared to be
intolerable?&nbsp; Divorce was not now the privilege of the
dissolute rich.&nbsp; Spirits which were incompatible need no
longer be compelled to fret beneath the same
cobbles.&rdquo;&nbsp; In short, she had recommended him to go to
England and get rid of his wife, as she would, with a little
encouragement, have recommended any man to get rid of
anything.&nbsp; I am sure that, had she been skilfully brought on
to the subject, she might have been induced to pronounce a
verdict against such ligatures for the body as coats, waistcoats,
and trowsers.&nbsp; Her aspirations for freedom ignored all
bounds, and, in theory, there were no barriers which she was not
willing to demolish.</p>
<p>Poor O&rsquo;Brien, as we all now began to see, had taken the
matter amiss.&nbsp; He had offered to make a bust of Mrs.
Talboys, and she had consented, expressing a wish that it might
find a place among those who had devoted themselves to the
enfranchisement of their fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I really think
she had but little of a woman&rsquo;s customary personal
vanity.&nbsp; I know she had an idea that her eye was lighted up
in her warmer moments by some special fire, that sparks of
liberty shone round her brow, and that her bosom heaved with
glorious aspirations; but all these feelings had reference to her
inner genius, not to any outward beauty.&nbsp; But O&rsquo;Brien
misunderstood the woman, and thought it necessary to gaze into
her face, and sigh as though his heart were breaking.&nbsp;
Indeed he declared to a young friend that Mrs. Talboys was
perfect in her style of beauty, and began the bust with this
idea.&nbsp; It was gradually becoming clear to us all that he
would bring himself to grief; but in such a matter who can
caution a man?</p>
<p>Mrs. Mackinnon had contrived to separate them in making the
carriage arrangements on this day, but this only added fuel to
the fire which was now burning within O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s
bosom.&nbsp; I believe that he really did love her, in his easy,
eager, susceptible Irish way.&nbsp; That he would get over the
little episode without any serious injury to his heart no one
doubted; but then, what would occur when the declaration was
made?&nbsp; How would Mrs. Talboys bear it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She deserves it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And twice as much,&rdquo; my wife added.&nbsp; Why is
it that women are so spiteful to each other?</p>
<p>Early in the day Mrs. Talboys clambered up to the top of a
tomb, and made a little speech, holding a parasol over her
head.&nbsp; Beneath her feet, she said, reposed the ashes of some
bloated senator, some glutton of the empire, who had swallowed
into his maw the provision necessary for a tribe.&nbsp; Old Rome
had fallen through such selfishness as that; but new Rome would
not forget the lesson.&nbsp; All this was very well, and then
O&rsquo;Brien helped her down; but after this there was no
separating them.&nbsp; For her own part she would sooner have had
Mackinnon at her elbow.&nbsp; But Mackinnon now had found some
other elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of that was as good as a feast,&rdquo; he had
said to his wife.&nbsp; And therefore Mrs. Talboys, quite
unconscious of evil, allowed herself to be engrossed by
O&rsquo;Brien.</p>
<p>And then, about three o&rsquo;clock, we returned to the
hamper.&nbsp; Luncheon under such circumstances always means
dinner, and we arranged ourselves for a very comfortable
meal.&nbsp; To those who know the tomb of Cecilia Metella no
description of the scene is necessary, and to those who do not,
no description will convey a fair idea of its reality.&nbsp; It
is itself a large low tower of great diameter, but of beautiful
proportion, standing far outside the city, close on to the side
of the old Roman way.&nbsp; It has been embattled on the top by
some latter-day baron, in order that it might be used for
protection to the castle, which has been built on and attached to
it.&nbsp; If I remember rightly, this was done by one of the
Frangipani, and a very lovely ruin he has made of it.&nbsp; I
know no castellated old tumble-down residence in Italy more
picturesque than this baronial adjunct to the old Roman tomb, or
which better tallies with the ideas engendered within our minds
by Mrs. Radcliffe and the Mysteries of Udolpho.&nbsp; It lies
along the road, protected on the side of the city by the proud
sepulchre of the Roman matron, and up to the long ruined walls of
the back of the building stretches a grassy slope, at the bottom
of which are the remains of an old Roman circus.&nbsp; Beyond
that is the long, thin, graceful line of the Claudian aqueduct,
with Soracte in the distance to the left, and Tivoli, Palestine,
and Frascati lying among the hills which bound the view.&nbsp;
That Frangipani baron was in the right of it, and I hope he got
the value of his money out of the residence which he built for
himself.&nbsp; I doubt, however, that he did but little good to
those who lived in his close neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We had a very comfortable little banquet seated on the broken
lumps of stone which lie about under the walls of the tomb.&nbsp;
I wonder whether the shade of Cecilia Metella was looking down
upon us.&nbsp; We have heard much of her in these latter days,
and yet we know nothing about her, nor can conceive why she was
honoured with a bigger tomb than any other Roman matron.&nbsp;
There were those then among our party who believed that she might
still come back among us, and with due assistance from some
cognate susceptible spirit, explain to us the cause of her
widowed husband&rsquo;s liberality.&nbsp; Alas, alas! if we may
judge of the Romans by ourselves, the true reason for such
sepulchral grandeur would redound little to the credit of the
lady Cecilia Metella herself, or to that of Crassus, her bereaved
and desolate lord.</p>
<p>She did not come among us on the occasion of this banquet,
possibly because we had no tables there to turn in preparation
for her presence; but, had she done so, she could not have been
more eloquent of things of the other world than was Mrs.
Talboys.&nbsp; I have said that Mrs. Talboys&rsquo; eye never
glanced more brightly after a glass of champagne, but I am
inclined to think that on this occasion it may have done
so.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien enacted Ganymede, and was, perhaps, more
liberal than other latter-day Ganymedes, to whose services Mrs.
Talboys had been accustomed.&nbsp; Let it not, however, be
suspected by any one that she exceeded the limits of a discreet
joyousness.&nbsp; By no means!&nbsp; The generous wine
penetrated, perhaps, to some inner cells of her heart, and
brought forth thoughts in sparkling words, which otherwise might
have remained concealed; but there was nothing in what she
thought or spoke calculated to give umbrage either to an
anchorite or to a vestal.&nbsp; A word or two she said or sung
about the flowing bowl, and once she called for Falernian; but
beyond this her converse was chiefly of the rights of man and the
weakness of women; of the iron ages that were past, and of the
golden time that was to come.</p>
<p>She called a toast and drank to the hopes of the latter
historians of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Then it was that she
bade O&rsquo;Brien &ldquo;Fill high the bowl with Samian
wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Irishman took her at her word, and she
raised the bumper, and waved it over her head before she put it
to her lips.&nbsp; I am bound to declare that she did not spill a
drop.&nbsp; &ldquo;The true &lsquo;Falernian grape,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she said, as she deposited the empty beaker on the grass beneath
her elbow.&nbsp; Viler champagne I do not think I ever swallowed;
but it was the theory of the wine, not its palpable body present
there, as it were, in the flesh, which inspired her.&nbsp; There
was really something grand about her on that occasion, and her
enthusiasm almost amounted to reality.</p>
<p>Mackinnon was amused, and encouraged her, as, I must confess,
did I also.&nbsp; Mrs. Mackinnon made useless little signs to her
husband, really fearing that the Falernian would do its good
offices too thoroughly.&nbsp; My wife, getting me apart as I
walked round the circle distributing viands, remarked that
&ldquo;the woman was a fool, and would disgrace
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I observed that after the disposal of
that bumper she worshipped the rosy god in theory only, and
therefore saw no occasion to interfere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
Bacchus,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and come, Silenus, if thou wilt;
I know that ye are hovering round the graves of your departed
favourites.&nbsp; And ye, too, nymphs of Egeria,&rdquo; and she
pointed to the classic grove which was all but close to us as we
sat there.&nbsp; &ldquo;In olden days ye did not always despise
the abodes of men.&nbsp; But why should we invoke the presence of
the gods,&mdash;we, who can become godlike ourselves!&nbsp; We
ourselves are the deities of the present age.&nbsp; For us shall
the tables be spread with ambrosia; for us shall the nectar
flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the whole it was very good fooling,&mdash;for awhile; and
as soon as we were tired of it we arose from our seats, and began
to stroll about the place.&nbsp; It was beginning to be a little
dusk, and somewhat cool, but the evening air was pleasant, and
the ladies, putting on their shawls, did not seem inclined at
once to get into the carriages.&nbsp; At any rate, Mrs. Talboys
was not so inclined, for she started down the hill towards the
long low wall of the old Roman circus at the bottom; and
O&rsquo;Brien, close at her elbow, started with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ida, my dear, you had better remain here,&rdquo; she
said to her daughter; &ldquo;you will be tired if you come as far
as we are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, mamma, I shall not,&rdquo; said Ida.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You get tired much quicker than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you will; besides I do not wish you to
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an end of it for Ida, and Mrs.
Talboys and O&rsquo;Brien walked off together, while we all
looked into each other&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a charity to go with them,&rdquo; said
Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you be charitable, then,&rdquo; said his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be a lady,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity that the mother of the spotless cherubim
is not here for the occasion,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hardly think that any one less gifted will undertake such a self
sacrifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any attempt of the kind would, however,
now have been too late, for they were already at the bottom of
the hill.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien had certainly drunk freely of the
pernicious contents of those long-necked bottles; and though no
one could fairly accuse him of being tipsy, nevertheless that
which might have made others drunk had made him bold, and he
dared to do&mdash;perhaps more than might become a man.&nbsp; If
under any circumstances he could be fool enough to make an avowal
of love to Mrs. Talboys, he might be expected, as we all thought,
to do it now.</p>
<p>We watched them as they made for a gap in the wall which led
through into the large enclosed space of the old circus.&nbsp; It
had been an arena for chariot games, and they had gone down with
the avowed purpose of searching where might have been the meta,
and ascertaining how the drivers could have turned when at their
full speed.&nbsp; For awhile we had heard their voices,&mdash;or
rather her voice especially.&nbsp; &ldquo;The heart of a man,
O&rsquo;Brien, should suffice for all emergencies,&rdquo; we had
heard her say.&nbsp; She had assumed a strange habit of calling
men by their simple names, as men address each other.&nbsp; When
she did this to Mackinnon, who was much older than herself, we
had been all amused by it, and, other ladies of our party had
taken to call him &ldquo;Mackinnon&rdquo; when Mrs. Talboys was
not by; but we had felt the comedy to be less safe with
O&rsquo;Brien, especially when, on one occasion, we heard him
address her as Arabella.&nbsp; She did not seem to be in any way
struck by his doing so, and we supposed, therefore, that it had
become frequent between them.&nbsp; What reply he made at the
moment about the heart of a man I do not know;&mdash;and then in
a few minutes they disappeared through the gap in the wall.</p>
<p>None of us followed them, though it would have seemed the most
natural thing in the world to do so had nothing out of the way
been expected.&nbsp; As it was we remained there round the tomb
quizzing the little foibles of our dear friend, and hoping that
O&rsquo;Brien would be quick in what he was doing.&nbsp; That he
would undoubtedly get a slap in the
face&mdash;metaphorically&mdash;we all felt certain, for none of
us doubted the rigid propriety of the lady&rsquo;s
intentions.&nbsp; Some of us strolled into the buildings, and
some of us got out on to the road; but we all of us were thinking
that O&rsquo;Brien was very slow a considerable time before we
saw Mrs. Talboys reappear through the gap.</p>
<p>At last, however, she was there, and we at once saw that she
was alone.&nbsp; She came on, breasting the hill with quick
steps, and when she drew near we could see that there was a frown
as of injured majesty on her brow.&nbsp; Mackinnon and his wife
went forward to meet her.&nbsp; If she were really in trouble it
would be fitting in some way to assist her; and of all women Mrs.
Mackinnon was the last to see another woman suffer from ill-usage
without attempting to aid her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I certainly never
liked her,&rdquo; Mrs. Mackinnon said afterwards; &ldquo;but I
was bound to go and hear her tale, when she really had a tale to
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Talboys now had a tale to tell,&mdash;if she chose to
tell it.&nbsp; The ladies of our party declared afterwards that
she would have acted more wisely had she kept to herself both
O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s words to her and her answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was well able to take care of herself,&rdquo; Mrs.
Mackinnon said; &ldquo;and, after all, the silly man had taken an
answer when he got it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not, however, that
O&rsquo;Brien had taken his answer quite immediately, as far as I
could understand from what we heard of the matter afterwards.</p>
<p>At the present moment Mrs. Talboys came up the rising ground
all alone, and at a quick pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man has insulted
me,&rdquo; she said aloud, as well as her panting breath would
allow her, and as soon as she was near enough to Mrs. Mackinnon
to speak to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mackinnon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose he has taken a little too much wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it was a premeditated insult.&nbsp; The
base-hearted churl has failed to understand the meaning of true,
honest sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will forget all about it when he is sober,&rdquo;
said Mackinnon, meaning to comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What care I what he remembers or what he
forgets!&rdquo; she said, turning upon poor Mackinnon
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You men grovel so in your
ideas&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; as Mackinnon
said afterwards, &ldquo;she had been telling me that I was a fool
for the last three weeks.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You men grovel so
in your ideas, that you cannot understand the feelings of a
true-hearted woman.&nbsp; What can his forgetfulness or his
remembrance be to me?&nbsp; Must not I remember this
insult?&nbsp; Is it possible that I should forget it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mackinnon only had gone forward to meet her; but,
nevertheless, she spoke so loud that all heard her who were still
clustered round the spot on which we had dined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has become of Mr. O&rsquo;Brien?&rdquo; a lady
whispered to me.</p>
<p>I had a field-glass with me, and, looking round, I saw his hat
as he was walking inside the walls of the circus in the direction
towards the city.&nbsp; &ldquo;And very foolish he must
feel,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt he is used to it,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But considering her age, you know,&rdquo; said the
first, who might have been perhaps three years younger than Mrs.
Talboys, and who was not herself averse to the excitement of a
moderate flirtation.&nbsp; But then why should she have been
averse, seeing that she had not as yet become subject to the will
of any imperial lord?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have felt much more foolish,&rdquo; said the
third, &ldquo;if she had listened to what he said to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the second;
&ldquo;nobody would have known anything about it then, and in a
few weeks they would have gradually become tired of each other in
the ordinary way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the meantime Mrs. Talboys was among us.&nbsp; There had
been no attempt at secresy, and she was still loudly inveighing
against the grovelling propensities of men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite true, Mrs. Talboys,&rdquo; said one of
the elder ladies; &ldquo;but then women are not always so careful
as they should be.&nbsp; Of course I do not mean to say that
there has been any fault on your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fault on my part!&nbsp; Of course there has been fault
on my part.&nbsp; No one can make any mistake without fault to
some extent.&nbsp; I took him to be a man of sense, and he is a
fool.&nbsp; Go to Naples indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he want you to go to Naples?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that was what he suggested.&nbsp; We were to leave
by the train for Civita Vecchia at six to-morrow morning and
catch the steamer which leaves Leghorn to-night.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me of wine.&nbsp; He was prepared for
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she looked round about on us with an air of
injured majesty in her face which was almost insupportable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether he took the tickets over-night,&rdquo;
said Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naples!&rdquo; she said, as though now speaking
exclusively to herself; &ldquo;the only ground in Italy which has
as yet made no struggle on behalf of freedom;&mdash;a fitting
residence for such a dastard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have found it very pleasant at this
season,&rdquo; said the unmarried lady, who was three years her
junior.</p>
<p>My wife had taken Ida out of the way when the first
complaining note from Mrs. Talboys had been heard ascending the
hill.&nbsp; But now, when matters began gradually to become
quiescent, she brought her back, suggesting, as she did so, that
they might begin to think of returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is getting very cold, Ida, dear, is it not?&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is Mr. O&rsquo;Brien?&rdquo; said Ida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has fled,&mdash;as poltroons always fly,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Talboys.&nbsp; I believe in my heart that she would have
been glad to have had him there in the middle of the circle, and
to have triumphed over him publicly among us all.&nbsp; No
feeling of shame would have kept her silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fled!&rdquo; said Ida, looking up into her
mother&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, fled, my child.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she seized her
daughter in her arms, and pressed her closely to her bosom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cowards always fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. O&rsquo;Brien a coward?&rdquo; Ida asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a coward, a very coward!&nbsp; And he has fled
before the glance of an honest woman&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Come,
Mrs. Mackinnon, shall we go back to the city?&nbsp; I am sorry
that the amusement of the day should have received this
check.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she walked forward to the carriage and
took her place in it with an air that showed that she was proud
of the way in which she had conducted herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a little conceited about it after all,&rdquo;
said that unmarried lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;If poor Mr. O&rsquo;Brien
had not shown so much premature anxiety with reference to that
little journey to Naples, things might have gone quietly after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the unmarried lady was wrong in her judgment.&nbsp; Mrs.
Talboys was proud and conceited in the matter,&mdash;but not
proud of having excited the admiration of her Irish lover.&nbsp;
She was proud of her own subsequent conduct, and gave herself
credit for coming out strongly as a noble-minded matron.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I believe she thinks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mackinnon,
&ldquo;that her virtue is quite Spartan and unique; and if she
remains in Rome she&rsquo;ll boast of it through the whole
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she does, she may be certain that O&rsquo;Brien will
do the same,&rdquo; said Mackinnon.&nbsp; &ldquo;And in spite of
his having fled from the field, it is upon the cards that he may
get the best of it.&nbsp; Mrs. Talboys is a very excellent
woman.&nbsp; She has proved her excellence beyond a doubt.&nbsp;
But, nevertheless, she is susceptible of ridicule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all felt a little anxiety to hear O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s
account of the matter, and after having deposited the ladies at
their homes, Mackinnon and I went off to his lodgings.&nbsp; At
first he was denied to us, but after awhile we got his servant to
acknowledge that he was at home, and then we made our way up to
his studio.&nbsp; We found him seated behind a half-formed model,
or rather a mere lump of clay punched into something resembling
the shape of a head, with a pipe in his mouth and a bit of stick
in his hand.&nbsp; He was pretending to work, though we both knew
that it was out of the question that he should do anything in his
present frame of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I heard my servant tell you that I was not at
home,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; said Mackinnon, &ldquo;and would
have sworn to it too if we would have let him.&nbsp; Come,
don&rsquo;t pretend to be surly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very busy, Mr. Mackinnon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Completing your head of Mrs. Talboys, I suppose, before
you start for Naples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that she has told you all
about it,&rdquo; and he turned away from his work, and looked up
into our faces with a comical expression, half of fun and half of
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every word of it,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you
want a lady to travel with you, never ask her to get up so early
in winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, O&rsquo;Brien, how could you be such an
ass?&rdquo; said Mackinnon.&nbsp; &ldquo;As it has turned out,
there is no very great harm done.&nbsp; You have insulted a
respectable middle-aged woman, the mother of a family, and the
wife of a general officer, and there is an end of
it;&mdash;unless, indeed, the general officer should come out
from England to call you to account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is welcome,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien,
haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Mackinnon;
&ldquo;that would be a dignified and pleasant ending to the
affair.&nbsp; But what I want to know is this;&mdash;what would
you have done if she had agreed to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never calculated on the possibility of such a
contingency,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens, then, I thought she would like it,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to oblige her you were content to sacrifice
yourself,&rdquo; said Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was just it.&nbsp; What the deuce is a
fellow to do when a woman goes on in that way.&nbsp; She told me
down there, upon the old race course you know, that matrimonial
bonds were made for fools and slaves.&nbsp; What was I to suppose
that she meant by that?&nbsp; But to make all sure, I asked her
what sort of a fellow the General was.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear old
man,&rsquo; she said, clasping her hands together.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He might, you know, have been my father.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wish he were,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;because then
you&rsquo;d be free.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am free,&rsquo; said
she, stamping on the ground, and looking up at me as much as to
say that she cared for no one.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;accept all that is left of the heart of Wenceslaus
O&rsquo;Brien,&rsquo; and I threw myself before her in her
path.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hand,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have none to
give, but the blood which runs red through my veins is descended
from a double line of kings.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said that because she
is always fond of riding a high horse.&nbsp; I had gotten close
under the wall, so that none of you should see me from the
tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what answer did she make?&rdquo; said
Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why she was pleased as Punch;&mdash;gave me both her
hands, and declared that we would be friends for ever.&nbsp; It
is my belief, Mackinnon, that that woman never heard anything of
the kind before.&nbsp; The General, no doubt, did it by
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was it that she changed her mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why; I got up, put my arm round her waist, and told her
that we would be off to Naples.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blest if she
didn&rsquo;t give me a knock in the ribs that nearly sent me
backwards.&nbsp; She took my breath away, so that I
couldn&rsquo;t speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was nothing more.&nbsp; Of course I saw how
it was.&nbsp; So she walked off one way and I the other.&nbsp; On
the whole I consider that I am well out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so do I,&rdquo; said Mackinnon, very gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But if you will allow me to give you my advice, I would
suggest that it would be well to avoid such mistakes in
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien, excusing
himself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what a man is to do under such
circumstances.&nbsp; I give you my honour that I did it all to
oblige her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We then decided that Mackinnon should convey to the injured
lady the humble apology of her late admirer.&nbsp; It was settled
that no detailed excuses should be made.&nbsp; It should be left
to her to consider whether the deed which had been done might
have been occasioned by wine, or by the folly of a
moment,&mdash;or by her own indiscreet enthusiasm.&nbsp; No one
but the two were present when the message was given, and
therefore we were obliged to trust to Mackinnon&rsquo;s accuracy
for an account of it.</p>
<p>She stood on very high ground indeed, he said, at first
refusing to hear anything that he had to say on the matter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The foolish young man,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;was
below her anger and below her contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not the first Irishman that has been made
indiscreet by beauty,&rdquo; said Mackinnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A truce to that,&rdquo; she replied, waving her hand
with an air of assumed majesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;The incident,
contemptible as it is, has been unpleasant to me.&nbsp; It will
necessitate my withdrawal from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mrs. Talboys; that will be making too much of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest hero that lives,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;may have his house made uninhabitable by a very small
insect.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mackinnon swore that those were her own
words.&nbsp; Consequently a sobriquet was attached to
O&rsquo;Brien of which he by no means approved.&nbsp; And from
that day we always called Mrs. Talboys &ldquo;the
hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackinnon prevailed at last with her, and she did not leave
Rome.&nbsp; She was even induced to send a message to
O&rsquo;Brien, conveying her forgiveness.&nbsp; They shook hands
together with great &eacute;clat in Mrs. Mackinnon&rsquo;s
drawing-room; but I do not suppose that she ever again offered to
him sympathy on the score of his matrimonial troubles.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
